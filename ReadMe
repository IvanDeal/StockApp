Stock control application based on the below criteria
*****************************************************************************************************
 Situation: 
You are creating an application to assist a new store with its stock! It only has a few products to start off with, but they want to keep track of what they have (lest they do a dreaded Sunday morning Stock take! D:)

Task:

    Write a console application that will report to the user the current stock amount for the item they are inquiring about.
    Data is provided (attached) in the form of an CSV document that your application will need to read to give the stock amount. Columns are in order: itemId, itemName, itemStockAmount.
    Helpful commands will be things like:
        StockApp.exe -help => Show a list of command options
        StockApp.exe -view [itemId] => Shows the name of the item with that itemId
        StockApp.exe -stock [itemId] => Shows the amount of items in stock for that itemId

If you have extra time, consider updating -stock to accept an item name in place of the itemId (assume that product names are always unique). 

Note: The app does not need to be left running. If you build it, you should be able to run StockApp.exe ... from a command prompt pointing to your project's bin/Debug or Release folder.
